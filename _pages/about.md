My name is Tordai DÃ¡niel, im a computer science student in Targu Mures, Romania at UMFST.
Im in my final year, and this page is for my Web programming course.

# Programming journey

First started programming in my first year of highschool, I attended the Bolyai Farkas Theoretical Highschool, mathematics and computer science specialization. We first started with C++ learned its syntax, and then moved on to basic algorithms. Then I started university at UMFST, and learned a lot more programming languages, and environments. I attented a summer internship at Aprilred in 2025, where I learned a lot about App development specifically in Flutter.

# Interests

I love programming, and I also like to play video games, when I have the time, so it would be cool to become a video game developer one day.
